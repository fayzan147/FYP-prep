# LearnCpp Exercises

This folder contains my C++ practice files and mini-projects following the [LearnCpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com) tutorial series.

The goal is to strengthen my understanding of C++ fundamentals in preparation for my final-year engineering project, which involves:

- Autonomous vehicle control
- AI and machine learning
- Vehicle modelling and simulation

Each `.cpp` file here represents a concept, lesson, or experiment based on what Iâ€™ve learned. This hands-on practice complements my academic modules in:

- Control Engineering  
- Vehicle Dynamics  
- Machine Intelligence  
- Simulation & Modelling

More files will be added as I work through the lessons.

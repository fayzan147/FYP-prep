# 🚗 Final Year Project Prep (FYP-Prep)

This repository contains my self-directed preparation for my final year engineering project focused on autonomous vehicle control, AI, and simulation.

I’m building skills in:
- 🐍 **Python** – for computer vision, machine learning, and control prototyping
- 💻 **C++** – for high-performance real-time systems
- 📊 **MATLAB/Simulink** – for modelling, simulation, and control system design

---

## 📁 Structure
- /cpp/ → C++ mini programs (basics, simulation logic, vehicle models)
- /python/ → Image processing, OpenCV, ML experiments
- /matlabsimulink/ → Control system models, vehicle dynamics simulations

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Learn core C++ syntax and object-oriented programming
- Build image pipelines in Python (e.g. edge detection, lane finding)
- Create simple vehicle models and controllers in Simulink
- Prepare for implementing real-time AI-based vehicle control in my final project

---

## 🛠 Tools & Tech
- Python 3, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, PyTorch  
- C++17  
- MATLAB R2023a + Simulink  
- Git & GitHub
